    question: "I don't have a clear idea of what I need. Can you still help?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many of our clients come to us with business problems rather than specific technical requirements. We'll work together to define your needs and find the right solution â€“ whether that's a simple website or a complex custom application."

    question: "How much does a project typically cost?",
    answer: "Every project is unique, so costs vary based on complexity, timeline, and specific requirements. We're transparent about pricing and will provide a detailed estimate before any work begins. What we can promise: you'll get excellent value for your investment."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer: "Our streamlined development process allows us to work significantly faster than traditional methods. A standard website might take 2-4 weeks, while more complex applications could require 8-12 weeks. We'll provide a timeline estimate during our initial consultation."
